# renpyable - What is it?

renpyable is simple command line program to correct filenames for files generated by Trueflow RIP.

What is not?

renpyable is not for allday use, it don't know how to rename files for pattern specified by user. Instead it will rename only files in specified (by  user) folder, generated by trueflow RIP.

## What is all about

Every Trueflow user know that you can change how your tiff/pdf files will be named by declaring specific variables in File name field.
For example pattern:

> File_%j_%o_%f

for this parameters:

> job_ticket_name = Sample Book Cover
> printing_sheet_number = 3
> printing_sheer_side = FRONT

will generate filename:

> File_Sample_Book_Cover_FOLD3_FRONT.tif

Everything would be alright but this kind off naming convention is not very good, according to sortability especially in windows and total commander.

For instance if We would like to create one pdf file from all our printing sheets using Acrobat this will be a mess. In Acrobat our files will unordered and will look like this:

> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD1_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD1_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD10_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD10_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD11_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD11_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD12_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD12_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD2_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD2_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD3_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD3_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD4_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD4_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD5_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD5_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD6_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD6_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD7_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD7_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD8_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD8_FRONT.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD9_BACK.tif
> File_Sample_Book_Middle_Pages_FOLD9_FRONT.tif


After merging pdf will not be in proper order.

So my program is renaming this files to better naming convention.

1. First of all it changes all uppercase to small letters
2. Next if will find a word front it changes it to afront
3. Then is searching for numbers in the string and every number it finds adding proper number of zeros before number

After this operations when we try to merge our files in Acrobat whe have very different picture than before changes.

> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold001_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold001_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold002_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold002_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold003_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold003_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold004_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold004_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold005_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold005_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold006_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold006_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold007_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold007_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold008_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold008_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold009_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold009_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold010_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold010_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold011_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold011_back.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold012_afront.tif
> file_sample_book_middle_pages_fold013_back.tif


# How to use it

For now there are no any installer or graphical interface. To use this program you will need to do a couple of things.

* First of all you will need to have  python 3.2 or later installed
* Next you need to clone repository to some folder on your disk

         git clone "https://github.com/propbono/renpyable.git"

  or just download a zip package and extract files to some folder.

         https://github.com/propbono/renpyable/archive/master.zip

* After that you need to copy a file "start.bat" to your desktop and edit it
* In "start.bat" you must set a full path to "renpyable.py" file.
* The last thing is to set up a path to folder when you are keeping tiff files. You set this up in "config.py" file

After that when you double click on start.bat program it will run and will change names for all files in declared 
earlier folder.
